### Introduction

This report will be about the race inequality rate of incarceration and how many of each races are in Prison and Jail, and the rise of incarceration rate over the years. I want to specifically focus on the AAPI, and Black variables since I believe the Black population have the worst experience with inequlity relating to incarceration, and I also want to do AAPI since i'm curious about the data of my own race.

### Summary Information

Write a summary paragraph of findings that includes the 5 values calculated from your summary information R script

These will likely be calculated using your DPLYR skills, answering questions such as:Â 

- What is the average value of my variable across all the counties (in the current year)?
- Where is my variable the highest / lowest?
- How much has my variable change over the last N years?

Feel free to calculate and report values that you find relevant. Again, remember that the purpose is to think about how these measure of incarceration vary by race.

### The Dataset

Who collected the data?  
How was the data collected or generated?  
Why was the data collected?  
How many observations (rows) are in your data?  
How many features (columns) are in the data?  
What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?  
What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)


### Trends Over Time Chart

![](Chart1.png)

This chart provides the trends of AAPI population in all the states, and gathers the states that are top 5 population wise, and gathers it on the data. From this data, it's easy to see that the number one is Hawaii, and lowest one out of the top 5 is Colorado.

### Variable Comparison Chart


![](Chart2.png)

This chart compares the population of White incacerated people and number of black incarcerated individuals over the years of 1970-2020. I included this chart since I wanted to know the simple differnce between the population, and if these 2 datas had any significant differences. It occured to me that even thought the chart says the population for white incarcerated individuals are higher, I believe the rate for black incarcerated individuals are higher, since they have a lower population in the U.S. and having the numbers be the same as white incarcerated populations in some years tell us the rate is a lot higher. 


### Map

![](Chart3.png)

For my map chart, I decided to collect the national data of the Black population in Jail, and displayed it on the map. With the legend, we can see that the lighter the color, more of the black population is in Jail, and with this map we can see taht states such as California, Texas, and Florida have the highest black incarcerated rate in the US.
